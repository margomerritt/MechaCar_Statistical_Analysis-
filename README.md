Summary Statistics:

After performing a linear regression on the MechaCar_MPG dataset we were able to determine the p-value and r-squared value. The p-value is 5.35e-11 and the R-squared value is 0.7149. 

Since the p-value = 5.35e-11 < 0.05 = alpha we reject the null hypothesis. Thus our slope of our linear model is not zero (m â‰  0).
