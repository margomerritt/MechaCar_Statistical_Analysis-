Summary Statistics:

After performing a linear regression on the MechaCar_MPG dataset we were able to determine the p-value and r-squared value. The p-value is 5.35e-11 and the R-squared value is 0.7149. 

Since the p-value = 5.35e-11 < 0.05 = alpha we reject the null hypothesis. Thus our slope of our linear model is not zero (m â‰  0). 

The linear model used in this regression is a multiple linear regression. Which is a statistical model that extends the scope and flexibility of a simple linear regression model. 
In our analysis we found our R-squared value to be 0.7149. Thus approximately 71% of our predictions of mpg of our MechaCar prototypes will be correct. This makes this linear model relatively effective in our statistical analysis.

From our statistic summary we see that vehicle length and ground clearance provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. Then the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD must provide random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
